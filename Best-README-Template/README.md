<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![ Implementation and Optimization in Convolution Operators in CNNs
][product-screenshot]] 
##(https://example.com)

Computers see images differently than us. While we see an image of a white cat the computer see  2-dimensional array full of numbers, also known as pixels. Just like how a baby begins to understand shapes and pictures, is very similar to how algorithms are given several images to be able to conclude what is given to make predictions.The study of convolutional neural networks and the one component that many people are still trying to optimize is enhancing the performance of each kernel and the accuracy of each outcome to obtain a specific output. In the process, we will create multiple kernels to perform a complicated task like features such as striding and padding.  A popular key method we used was the implementation of different convolutional kernels and to measure their performance which is identified by the best performer. One of our expected outcomes is to have and identify the best performing kernel so after we implemented the kernels we see how such kernel works best as seen on the graph. People can now implement our library to integrate into existing neural network frameworks and this will result in training neural networks faster and those who use neural networks. We can now make this open-source so anyone who has a GitHub or even internet access may have access and inform open-source software community. It is imperative that we work on documenting the library implementation because we must give credit to whom credit is due.

Here's why:
* The implementation of this technology greatly supports other fields. For example, use a convolutional neural network to analyze time and space details on traffic between any two cities. In the case of medical diagnosis use CNNs to scan human organs. 

*  Our research analyzes different implementations of convolution kernels. These are small matrices that scan images to extract the most important parts
* Being able to optimize a kernel and add features to a CNN to get the output of our choosing is benefitial to all including us. 

Additional Information?

### Built With
What should I say about the frameworks used? We just used nano cmd and deep learning book..
* [???](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [???](https://jquery.com)
* [???](https://laravel.com)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

We dont need to install anything I believe.

### Prerequisites

Information from the deep learning book i beleive, thats it?
* nothing
```sh
Need additional help with this section 
```

### Installation

1. Should I insert the dive into deep learning book link? [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/PrinceSenju/Convolutional_N.git
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Should I use this space to explain the features?
```sh
-c <count>      Specify the number of test iterations
        -x <width>      Specify the input image width
        -y <height>     Specify the input image height
        -kw <width>     Specify the kernel width
        -kh <height>    Specify the kernel height
        -vs <stride>    Specify the vertical striding
        -hs <stride>    Specify the horizontal striding
        -p              Specify to use 0 padding
        -o              Specify to output results
        -k <kernel type>        Specify the kernel type: 1 for 2d kernel, 2 for separable kernel
        -m <kernel model>       Specify the kernel model: 1 for direct and 2 for 0-pad first.
```
_Please add or tell me any additional information to add._
